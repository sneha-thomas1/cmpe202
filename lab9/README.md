# Decorator pattern Using Lambda<br />
- With decorators,everytime you need an added behaviour,you need to add extra class,but with Lambda you dont need additional classes,but can implement this extra behaviour using lambda expression.<br />
- It's simple and more easy to understand.<br />
- Was able to avoid class inheritance using Lambda.
