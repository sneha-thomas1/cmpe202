# Decorator pattern Using Lambda
With decorators,everytime you need an added behaviour,you need to add extra class,but with Lambda you dont need additional classes,but can implement this extra behaviour using lambda expression.
It's simple and more easy to understand.
Was able to avoid class inheritance using Lambda.
